Budget App is a project inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann, which I redesigned with added functionality and optimized with responsive design. I am particularly proud of the speedometer functionality and feel that it gives a lot to the project. In the future I would update this app by using a backend server and user sessions to store data, so people won't lose their information every time they leave the page.
